Background
======
I am a current twelfth grade student at Eastside Preparatory School in Kirkland, WA, committed to the Johns Hopkins class of 2028. My academic and research interests lay at the instersection of computer science and biomedicine. Specifically, I am looking to explore AI/ML solutions to pressing problems in healthcare, such as diagnostics. I bring previous interdisciplinary CS research experience, a high level of CS and mathematics ability, and considerable leadership and collaboration experience.

Research Experience
======

**Investigation of the Paschen Curve for Various Electrode Geometries in IEC Fusion Devices through Monte Carlo Simulations**  
William Bowers, Sophia Gershaft (equal contribution, alphabetical order)  
arXiv (preprint), September, 2023 [[view full paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07184)]
* **Abbreviated Abstract:** The creation of plasma is key for achieving fusion in Inertial Electrostatic Confinement fusion devices, and the conditions for such electrical breakdown are modelled by Paschen's law. However, the Paschen curve only models parallel plate configurations of electrodes and is rarely explored in the more complex electrode geometries often seen in IEC fusion devices. To bridge this gap, we study the Paschen curve for various electrode configurations by use of Monte Carlo simulations. 

* **Research Context:** I was prompted to pursue this research by surprising results from the experimental fusion reactor setup at Eastside Preparatory School. During one of our plasma creation experiments, we recorded data that failed to fit the standard model for plasma creation. A peer and I shared these results with the project mentors, Dr. Charles Whitmer and Gunnar Mein, and we decided to launch a research project to explore further. 

**Leveraging Brain-Computer Interface Technology for Mental Workload Classification**  
William Bowers  
International Youth Neuroscience Association Journal, November, 2023 [[view full paper](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1rMte2kMAicbLDzT-beIL8QT7o2eP3eAE)]
* **Abbreviated Abstract:** Guided by a University of Washington Center for Neurotechnology advisor, we are developing a BCI project with the goal of classifying a user's mental state as "active" or "relaxed". To achieve this, we modify modifying a Neurosky Mindflex headset to connect with an Arduino microcontroller, which transmits brainwave data to a Python program using a support vector machine for classification. We achieve an 80% accuracy in distinguishing between these mental states.

* **Research Context:** Two years ago I founded and co-led an R&D team of six students creating a brain-computer interface device. Our initial described in the above paper. Since then, we have pivoted towards a more capable device focused on recognizing motor intent of the hands via FFT analysis of the mu rhythm. We built a custom headset and custom circuitry, and we reached a prototype and wrapped up in winter 2024. I also presented on the project at the **Stanford High School Neuroscience Virtual Forum**. 

Both of these research efforts have greatly expanded my grasp of **computational modeling, data science, machine learning, statistics, and interdisciplinary computer science research** - skills I plan to bring to my research at Hopkins.

Selected Projects, Internships, & Activities
======

**Biomedical chatbot project:** In an advanced ML course, I created a knowledge-embedding LLM system called MD-GPT that specializes in answering biomedical questions, such as those revolving around symptoms, treatment, diagnosis, etc. See the project repo [here](https://github.com/WilliamB-EPS/md-gpt).

**RecycleScan app project & nonprofit:** I led eight students to create an app called RecycleScan, where users scan pieces of waste and learn how to dispose of that waste via a computer vision algorithm. I developed the backend using Amazon Cloud Services and created the AI algorithm in Tensorflow. The Kirkland City Council has been supporting the app's development for local use. Since launching the app in open beta, we've allowed users to scan and properly dispose of thousands of waste items locally. Try it [here](https://www.theplasticproject.org/recyclescan).

**Together science R&D internship:** During summer 2023, I interned at Together Science, a tech startup creating an online tool together.math that allows students to efficiently solve math problems. I began development of a considerably more advanced underlying [math library](https://github.com/together-science/symtype) based off the SymType library for python. In summer 2024, I also began work on a proprietary novel reinforcement learning algorithm harnessing graph neural networks to solve mathematical equations, with the goal of creating a more intelligent instant feedback system.

**Music:** I have been a violinist since the age of four! Since then, I studied with Andrea Talley, Marcus Talley, and Eduardo Rios - assisstant concertmaster of the Seattle Symphony. In addition to regular recitals, I perform in the Seattle Youth Symphony, where I am currently in the first violin section and was previously principal second violin.
